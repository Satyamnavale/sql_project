## Project Description
Create a database to manage cricket player records, match performance, and tournament statistics. 
This system helps track player achievements, team standings, and overall performance in an efficient and scalable way.
Team Management:The system stores information about cricket teams, including the team name, coach, and captain.

Player Management:Player details, such as name, date of birth, nationality, role (batsman, bowler, all-rounder), and associated team, are stored and maintained.

Match Performance Tracking:Each match between teams is recorded with match details (date, venue, type), and player performances are tracked (runs scored, wickets taken, balls faced, overs bowled).

Ranking System:Players are ranked based on their total runs, wickets, batting average, and bowling economy, and each team is also ranked based on their performance.

Data Integrity:The system uses triggers to automatically update player statistics and rankings after each match, ensuring data consistency.

Performance Reports and Leaderboards:PL/SQL procedures are used to generate detailed player performance reports and generate leaderboards for the best-performing players.

## Key Features:

Design tables to store player details, team data, and match statistics.
Write SQL queries to retrieve player stats and team rankings.
Implement triggers to update player records automatically after each match.
Use PL/SQL procedures to generate performance reports and leaderboards.
Add constraints to ensure valid data entry (e.g., no duplicate players in a team).

## Technologies Used
PL/SQL (Oracle Database)
SQL (for queries, stored procedures)

## Guidance:
Project created under the guidance of Sir Aniruddh Gaikwad.
